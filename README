Classic X11 cursors scaled 2x

If you like the aesthetic of the default X cursors but find them too small
for your 120+ DPI display, look no further.
This is just the simple cursor font taken from
https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/font/cursor-misc and scaled up to twice the
size.

To install, run make and make install. By default, the font is installed to
/usr/share/fonts/misc, pass OUT= if you want to install it elsewhere.

Requires bdftopcf and mkfontdir.

Eventually I will make the cursors smoother so they look a bit better.
